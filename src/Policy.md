## Policy

Names in CNS follow the convention: 

```text
<name>.<domain-suffix>
```

For example, hiya.xch or icer.xch
Each field is explained below:

- **Domain Suffix**.
    The domain suffix (such as .xch) identifies the registry to which the name belongs.
- **Name**.
    Name is the main identifier that accepts numbers, letters (case insensitive), _(underscore), -(dash).

Emoji will be transformed into Unicode, for example, ðŸ˜Š = 567890 = xn-567890ï¼Œthus ðŸ˜Š.xch is equivalent to xn-567890.xch.
