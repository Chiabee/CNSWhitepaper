## Resolution

What is Forward Resolution?
Let's say you want to send your friend 1 AVAX. Normally, you must ask for their wallet address (0x0000…), and then you can transfer to that address. Unfortunately, the address is difficult to remember.

To simplify the process, you can use a domain name. Your friend can register johndoe.avax, and configure johndoe.avax to resolve to their wallet address. Then, you can transfer them funds knowing only their domain name.

What is Reverse Resolution?
Reverse Resolution is the process of taking a piece of data like a wallet address (0x0000…) and finding the related .avax domain.
