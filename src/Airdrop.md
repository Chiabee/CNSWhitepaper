# It's Time! The CNS Airdrop Program Has Launched!
Dear friends, it's been a while!

After enduring a prolonged bear market, we finally see the dawn of a bull market. Although the price of XCH has not changed markedly, we have a group of very loyal users, a group of firm supporters of the Chia blockchain. It is because of you that Chia ecological developers, including CNS, are motived to keep moving forward.

Now, it's time!

We are thrilled to announce that on the first anniversary of CNS's launch, we are unfolding our CNS token airdrop program! Simultaneously, several other things are happening:

- We will be releasing the renewal function of CNS in the near future, and gradually lifting the character registration limit later in the year (all currently expired domain names will automatically be extended until the renewal function becomes available).
- We have partnered with ChiaXGRANT, where a part of the CNS sales revenues will be injected into ChiaXGRANT's fund pool, serving to support the development of the entire Chia ecosystem.
- We have completed the snapshot for the first airdrop. Remember, there will be more than one airdrops, so there are plenty of opportunities for you!
- We will launch a CNS token incentive program, designed to promote the integration of CNS in the Chia ecosystem.

Here are more details:

## CNS Renewal Plan:
CNS beta was officially opened for public registration on February 14th, 2023, limiting registrations to domain names composed of six characters or more, and only for a one-year period. For the past year, CNS's domain service has been running stably. You can enter the domain name for transfer operations in the Pawket wallet, or visit yourname.xch.cool to view your personal homepage.

After a year of operation and exploration, we are confident that we can support more traffic and provide more services. We decided to release the renewal feature for CNS soon, and gradually remove the character limitation on registration throughout this year. Here is our plan:

- All domain names that are about to expire soon will get an automatic extension until March 14, 2024. Even if your domain name shows to be expired before this, you can still use it as normal.
- After March 15, all expired domain names can be renewed. We will open the renewal channel on our official site at that time, so please be alert for our latest news.
- After each domain name expires, if you don’t renew it straight away, the domain resolution services associated with your domain name will pause and enter a 90-day grace period. During this grace period, you can renew your domain at any time without worrying about someone else registering it. Once successfully renewed, your domain can be resolved normally.
- If you fail to renew your domain during the grace period, it will be released for others to register.
- If you have any questions about renewing, feel free to leave a message on our discord. Our staff will be happy to assist you.

## ChiaXGRANT Collaboration:
At the outset, CNS pledged that part of our sales revenues would be devoted to supporting the Chia ecosystem. To fulfil this commitment, we have partnered with [ChiaXGRANT](https://twitter.com/CHIAXGRANT), planning to donate all registration fee portion (not including annual fees and royalties) of the CNS sales revenue over the past year to ChiaXGRANT to support the development of the Chia ecosystem. We are also going to continue investing more funds in the future and looking forward to getting more outstanding developers to join the big Chia family!

Breakdown of CNS sales revenue:
- Royalties: 5%, awarded to the distributors. If you want to become a distributor of CNS, refer to our deployment methods published on [Github](https://github.com/SutuLabs/ChiaNameServiceRegistrar) for guidance.
- Registration fee: This is the fee charged when registering a CNS domain for the first time. This portion serves as the ecosystem fund, supporting the development of Chia ecosystem projects, including CNS.
- Annual fee: Charged annually, used for project maintenance.
- For example, the current sale price for a 6-character CNS domain name is 0.4xch, of which, 0.15xch constitutes the registration fee and goes into the ecosystem fund, while 0.25xch is the annual fee used for project maintenance. An additional 5% royalty is given to CNS distributors.


## CNS Token Distribution:
We have launched our token CNS (AssetID:`ba36df73e5f4ddd5c298bba7030678ebc1bbc5d4431663cffd0747099f81d8bb`), with an initial supply of 100,000,000 tokens. These tokens are aimed at driving the governance and propelling incentives within the CNS ecosystem. CNS token holders can participate in governance voting, or engage in strategies like staking and liquidity provision to earn rewards.

The token distribution plan is as follows:

- Founding team: 2.5% — to be locked for three years, with 1/3 unlocked annually.
- Execution/Operation/Advisory team: 12.5% — set aside to cover labor costs for the execution/operation/advisory team over the next five years.
- Airdrops: 25% — we expect to have 4 to 5 rounds of airdrops. The first round has already been snapshotted. More on the airdrop program can be found below.
- Community Incentives: 37.5% — destined to incentivize the community members to participate in the building of CNS.
- Treasury: 22.5% — used for providing liquidity, issuing staking rewards, and other purposes.

Beyond these distributions, CNS tokens will be designed to have an inflationary model. The inflation rate will not exceed 2% annually, the specific figure will be determined by governance voting.

## CNS Airdrop Program:
25% of CNS tokens (i.e., 25 million tokens) will be used for airdrops, targeting CNS registered users and partners.

Starting this year, we will conduct multiple rounds of airdrops. The first round was snapshotted on February 14, 2024. The airdrop targets for this round are:

- CNS registered users - based on the addresses bound with CNS domain names (by default, bound addresses are domain name holding addresses).
- CNS pre-launch testing users - based on the addresses bound with CNS test domain names (by default, bound addresses are testing domain's holding addresses).
- Holders of PassPaw NFT.
- Any addresses that have donated more than 0.001 XCH to Pawket.xch (xch16xwqtf2d4jljks8lfpp4xnz8jak7jqjxc07y9tqlgt4grdp5hr4q7vcx3s), or have made a direct donation to the Pakwet team.

The snapshot for this airdrop has already been taken, with all tokens directly sent to the corresponding addresses. There's no need to manually claim. We will announce the list of qualified addresses later.

**Don't believe in any airdrop links from the comment section! Stay safe!**

Finally, let’s anticipate together that the upcoming year will be even more exciting for the Chia ecosystem!
