## Risk Mitigation

1. How to prevent/mitigate domain squatting.
2. How to restrict or respect expiry policy (for the cost of a yearly renewal).
3. How to verify a domain without a central authority. (the mechanism used by keybase can be a great inspiration.)
4. When we need more metadata (maybe large) to be associated with the domain, how this metadata can be properly handled and stored?
5. How we work with others to spread the usage of CNS and even integrated it into the Official Client.
