    - If the domain has already been registered, it will be displayed as `registered`.
    - If the name does not meet the registration rules, `Unavailable` will be displayed.

1. Check the details (name, registration fee, annual fee, royalties, etc.), then click `Register`.

   TIPS
   - The address entered here is the address you want the domain name to be bound to. If it is not filled in, it will automatically point to the owner's address.If you transfer the NFT later, the domain name address will automatically point to the new owner's address.
   - If you have entered a binding address, then even if you transfer the NFT later, the binding address will not be automatically released.
   - You can modify the binding address through the Pawket wallet after purchase. (Currently, only the Pawket wallet can be used to modify it).

1. After clicking "register", an offer file will be automatically generated. It may take about 10~20 seconds. If the website has too many visitors, it may time out and fail. You can refresh and try again

  NOTE:This is a special offer, and your domain name NFT is not actually minted until this offer is accepted. Minting and sending happen at the same time. Therefore, you cannot see the preview of NFT in advance like other offers.Don't worry, you can still accept the offer and wait for the block confirmation.
